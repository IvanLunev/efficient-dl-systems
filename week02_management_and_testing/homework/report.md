# Task 1

* Added **test_conv_block** to check **ConvBlock**
* Added **test_down_block** to check **DownBlock**
* Added **test_up_block** to check **UpBlock**
* Added **test_time_emb** to check **TimestepEmbedding**
* **test_unet** failed in the row: ```x = torch.cat((x, skip), 1)```. Tensors had different sizes. I found that ```temb``` tensor doesn't have h*w dimentions (it is obvious after **test_time_emb**), so after summing ```thro + temb``` we have wrong size. I added unsqueeze: ```temb = temb.unsqueeze(2).unsqueeze(3)```
* In ```get_schedules``` added assert, that betas more than zero
* Found mistake in ```DiffusionModel``` in ```forward```. In formula ```self.sqrt_one_minus_alpha_prod``` should be used
* In ```test_diffusion``` added ```torch.manual_seed(26)``` with appropriate seed to make ```1.0 <= output <= 1.2``` true (MSE can be less than 1.0 in general)
* In ```test_diffusion``` added test of ```sample```
* To pass ```test_train_on_one_batch``` added ```device``` attribute to the ```DiffusionModel```
* Implemented ```test_training``` that check training pipline of the 'cuda' and 'cpu' devices. After wrong outputs (images had only noise) found in ```DiffusionModel.forward``` that ```rand_like``` should be changed to ```randn_like```
* Coverage:

# Task 2

* All training hyperparameters and models hyperpaameters added to ```hparams.py``` file
* wandb logging of all hyperparameters, training loss, learning rate added
* wandb logging of input and generated images from each epoch added

# Task 3

* Transformed ```hparam.py``` into ```conf/config.yaml```
* Config added in ```wandb.init```
* Added chose of optimazer
* Added existence of random flip augmentations

# Task 4

* Added dvc pipeline
* Added config groups
* Added ```prepare_data.py``` script
